# Spark-Holographic-Shader
A holographic shader for Unity built for use in VRChat, built using Amplify Shader Editor.

It has three zones which can be masked either via image textures or vertex colors(R,G,B, exclusive), local mesh/worldspace texture alignment, 3D triplanar texture projection, fresnel adjustment, and transparency options.
