# Spark-Holographic-Shader
A holographic shader for Unity built for use in VRChat, built using Amplify Shader Editor.

Supports local mesh/worldspace texture alignment, 3D triplanar texture projection, fresnel adjustment, and scrolling textures(2D or 3D).
There is also a variant with three masked zones, either via image textures or vertex colors(R,G,B).
